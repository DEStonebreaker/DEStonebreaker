Hi, my name is Donovan and I am a Computer Science and Applied Math student.  
My favorite topics to work with are Graph theory, network programming, and memory management.  

A lot of my repos, if public, are more likely than not some random junk drawers that I use to sync files between my laptop and desktop.
